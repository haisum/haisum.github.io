title: Wrong words at wrong time
---

This happened almost an year ago. I was in Dubai, dressing up to go to work in morning. My home mate was in good mood this morning so he offered me and another mate a ride to office which we gladly accepted. So we sit in car and set off, my friend though to take a "short cut" and went in a service lane and got out of it at wrong side on a road which was not one way. In his defense, if you have been to Dubai, it's a city with big one way roads and two ways road are very rare. As we get out of service lane a big dumper is coming our way from other side right one our faces. All of us were damn sure we can't do anything about it, only the dumper driver can apply brakes and save us. So almost certain of our deaths, two friends start remembering God. Muslims usually say Allah u Akbar, or recite some other verse in such situations and it's considered good and useful in after life for them to remember God in last moments of life. Apparently I am not good at playing Muslim and as soon as I saw dumper a lot of F-Bombs dropped out of mouth. It went like this:

Friend One: Allah-oo-Akbar Allah-Akbar
Friend Two: La illah Illalah Muhammad Rasulillah
Me: Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck

Dumper driver did apply brakes in time and three idiots were saved. When it all ended, two friends looked at me with anger and said you should have been remembering God at such times... what would you have answered him had you died right now? your last words were "Fuck Fuck Fuck".

Even after an year, now when I think about it, I guess this story would make a great legend in hell had I died that day: "Hey listen we have a guy whose last words were: Fuck Fuck Fuck" :D
