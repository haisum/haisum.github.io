title: I am now AWS Certified Developer
---

Two months ago, I got [my AWS Solutions Architect certification](/2019/10/11/aws-9-solutions-architect-certificate/). Now, I am AWS certified developer as well. Here's my latest certificate:

I scored 982/1000 which was mind blowing, even for me. I didn't expect to do this good.

I used [Stephane Maarek's Ultimate AWS Certified Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/) course and [Jon Bonso's Practice Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-exams-amazon/). These two, along with practicing everything on AWS should be enough for anyone to pass the exam. There isn't anything which isn't covered in two of these.

I also have Linux Academy yearly membership so I did around 50% of course they have for this certification. I also gave Linux academy practice test and followed labs there for practice. Linux Academy is amazing but Staphane's course and Jon Bonso's practice exams are really comprehensive and are far better than Linux Academy and A Cloud Guru's offerings.
