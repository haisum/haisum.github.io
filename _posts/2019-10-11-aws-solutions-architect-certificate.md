title: Got My AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification
---

I am very glad to share that I passed my AWS Solutions Architect Exam two days ago. I studied daily for two months to get this baby. I will be sharing more details on how I prepared and got it. For now, I will shamelessly show off my new certification.
